# Analystt.ai


Here the final.py is the python file for task 1.<br>
output_{page_number}.html corresponds to the html file of the respective pagenumber after the search.<br>
Amazon was restricting beautiful soup, so as an alternative I used webscraper.io extension to gather data in analystt.csv.<br>
Further required output.csv was generated from analystt.csv after data preprocessing done in Untitled.ipynb<br>
